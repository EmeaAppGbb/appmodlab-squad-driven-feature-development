## 🌌 OVERVIEW

Welcome, brave developer, to the **SQUAD-DRIVEN FEATURE DEVELOPMENT** lab! In this epic quest, you'll harness the full power of your AI party to plan, implement, test, and ship a **complete feature** to a production-grade polyglot codebase.

Your mission: Build a **Product Review & Recommendation System** for **ShopSmart**, a bustling e-commerce platform running on **TypeScript (Node.js)** and **Python (FastAPI)**. The platform already has products, users, and orders working perfectly — but the reviews and recommendations modules are **empty shells** waiting for your SQUAD to breathe life into them.

This isn't a tutorial where you follow step-by-step instructions. This is **open-world gameplay**. You'll brief **Brain** 🧠 (the strategist), coordinate **Hands** 👐 (the builders) across languages, summon **Eyes** 👁️ (the reviewer) to inspect quality, and deploy **Mouth** 💬 (the documenter) to write the lore. Together, your party will deliver production-ready code.

**🎯 QUEST OBJECTIVE:** Ship a fully functional review + recommendation system using SQUAD.

## 🛒 THE SHOPSMART PLATFORM

**ShopSmart** is a modern e-commerce platform with a microservices architecture:

### 🟢 **What's Already Working**

| **Feature**      | **Technology** | **Status** | **Description**                          |
|------------------|----------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Product Catalog  | TypeScript     | ✅ Live    | Browse products, search, filter          |
| User Management  | TypeScript     | ✅ Live    | Registration, auth, profiles             |
| Order System     | TypeScript     | ✅ Live    | Cart, checkout, order tracking           |
| Database         | PostgreSQL     | ✅ Live    | Relational data with migrations          |
| API Gateway      | Express        | ✅ Live    | RESTful API at `localhost:3000`          |
| ML Service       | FastAPI        | ✅ Live    | Health endpoint only (waiting for models)|

### 🔴 **What's Missing (Your Quest)**

The platform has **skeleton code** for reviews and recommendations, but they're not implemented. Customers can browse and buy products, but they can't:
- ❌ Submit product reviews
- ❌ See aggregated ratings
- ❌ Get personalized recommendations
- ❌ View "customers who liked this also liked..." suggestions

**This is where your SQUAD comes in.**

---

## 🎯 THE FEATURE SQUAD WILL BUILD

You'll implement a **production-grade Product Review & Recommendation System** with the following components:

### 📝 **Product Review System**
- **Review Submission API** (TypeScript)
  - POST `/api/reviews` — Submit a review with rating (1-5) and text
  - GET `/api/reviews/:productId` — Fetch reviews for a product
  - GET `/api/reviews/:reviewId` — Get a specific review
- **Review Moderation** (Python)
  - Sentiment analysis to detect toxic/spam reviews
  - Auto-flag suspicious content for human review
- **Review Aggregation**
  - Calculate average ratings per product
  - Count total reviews
  - Provide star distribution (5-star: 40%, 4-star: 30%, etc.)

### 🎲 **Recommendation Engine**
- **Collaborative Filtering** (Python)
  - "Customers who liked this also liked..." algorithm
  - Matrix factorization or item-based similarity
- **Recommendation API** (TypeScript)
  - GET `/api/recommendations/:userId` — Personalized product suggestions
  - GET `/api/recommendations/similar/:productId` — Similar products
- **Real-time Integration**
  - TypeScript API calls Python ML service
  - Caching layer for performance
  - Fallback to trending products if no data

### 🛡️ **Anti-Fraud Detection**
- Detect duplicate reviews from same user/IP
- Rate limiting on review submissions
- Velocity checks (too many reviews in short time)

### 🏗️ **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention
- **Performance**: Response time <200ms (API), <500ms (ML)
- **Testing**: Unit tests + integration tests
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs, README with examples

---

## 🕹️ LAB WALKTHROUGH

### 💎 **STEP 1: SET UP ENVIRONMENT**

**🎯 Objective:** Get the platform running locally.

```bash
cd shopsmart
docker-compose up -d
```

**Verify all services are healthy:**
```bash

# ML service health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test existing endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/api/orders | jq
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** All services respond with 200 OK.

**🌟 +100 XP — Environment Ready!**

---

### ⚔️ **STEP 3: ARCHITECTURE DECISION**

**🎯 Objective:** Review Brain's proposal and approve the approach.

Brain will present a plan that might look like:

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  review_text TEXT,
  sentiment_score FLOAT,
  is_flagged BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_product ON reviews(product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_user ON reviews(user_id);
```

**API Endpoints:**
- POST `/api/reviews`
- GET `/api/reviews/:productId`
- GET `/api/reviews/:reviewId`
- GET `/api/recommendations/:userId`
- GET `/api/recommendations/similar/:productId`

**ML Services:**
- Sentiment analysis using transformers (Hugging Face)
- Item-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity

**Your job:** Review, ask follow-up questions, approve or request changes.

**🌟 +100 XP — Architecture Approved!**

---

### 👐 **STEP 4: IMPLEMENT REVIEW API (TYPESCRIPT)**

**🎯 Objective:** Have Hands build the TypeScript review endpoints.

Summon Hands:

```bash
gh copilot squad -a Hands
```

**Example Directive:**

### 🐍 **STEP 5: IMPLEMENT ML SERVICE (PYTHON)**

**🎯 Objective:** Have Hands build the Python sentiment analysis and recommendation engine.

Brief Hands again (or continue the conversation):

> "Hands, now implement the ML service components in Python.
>
> **Tasks:**
> 1. Implement `ml-service/src/models/sentiment.py`:
>    - Use transformers library for sentiment analysis
>    - Return sentiment score (-1 to 1)
>    - Flag toxic content
> 2. Implement `ml-service/src/models/recommender.py`:
>    - Collaborative filtering using item-based similarity
>    - Cosine similarity on user-product interaction matrix
>    - Return top 10 recommendations
> 3. Update `ml-service/src/api/routes.py`:
>    - POST /analyze-sentiment
>    - POST /recommend/:userId
>    - POST /similar/:productId
> 4. Add tests in `ml-service/tests/`
> 5. Update `pyproject.toml` with dependencies (transformers, scikit-learn, numpy)
>
> Make sure it integrates with the TypeScript API via HTTP calls."

**⏳ Hands will build the Python components...**

## 📜 SOLUTION WALKTHROUGH

> The complete solution is on the `solution-final` branch with tagged commits for each step.

```bash
git checkout solution-final
```

### Step 1: Explore Application (`step-01-explore-app`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "Analyze the ShopSmart e-commerce application codebase. Identify the tech stack, architecture, existing features, and areas for improvement." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** Identified TypeScript/Fastify API + Python/FastAPI ML service, PostgreSQL + Redis, Docker Compose. Reviews module is empty stub (`shopsmart/api/src/modules/reviews/.gitkeep`).

### Step 2: Initialize Squad (`step-02-initialize-squad`)

```bash
npx @bradygaster/squad-cli init
```

**Result:** Assembled SQUAD — Brain 🧠 (strategist), Hands 👐 (builder), Eyes 👁️ (reviewer), Mouth 💬 (documenter).

### Step 3: Feature Planning (`step-03-feature-planning`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "As the Squad Lead, create a feature development plan for adding a product review and rating system to ShopSmart. Break it down into tasks for each agent." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** Brain created 5-phase plan with 17 tasks: Backend API → ML Recommendations → Testing → Code Review → Documentation.

### Step 4: Backend Implementation (`step-04-backend-impl`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "As the Squad Backend developer, implement the product review API endpoints: POST /api/reviews, GET /api/products/:id/reviews, PUT /api/reviews/:id, DELETE /api/reviews/:id. Include data models, validation, and database integration." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** Created 4 files mirroring the Product module pattern:
- `review.types.ts` — Review, CreateReviewInput, UpdateReviewInput, ProductRating
- `review.schema.ts` — Fastify JSON Schema validation
- `review.service.ts` — CRUD + rating aggregation with parameterized queries
- `review.routes.ts` — 6 REST endpoints
- Updated `server.ts` to register review routes

### Step 5: ML Service Implementation (`step-05-frontend-impl`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "As the Squad ML developer, implement the recommendation engine with collaborative filtering and similar products." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** Built recommendation engine:
- `recommendation.py` — Pydantic models
- `engine.py` — Collaborative filtering + popular products fallback
- `router.py` — FastAPI endpoints for user recommendations and similar products
- Updated `main.py` with router and lifecycle events

### Step 6: Test Suite (`step-06-test-suite`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "As the Squad Tester, write comprehensive tests for the review system and recommendation engine." --allow-all-tools --yolo
npx vitest run  # 18 tests passed ✅
```

**Result:** 16 TypeScript tests (ReviewService CRUD) + 11 Python tests (models, engine, endpoints). All passing.

### Step 7: Code Review (`step-07-code-review`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "As the Squad Reviewer, perform a multi-agent code review covering security, performance, and code quality." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** APPROVED ✅ — Parameterized queries (no SQL injection), proper indexing, consistent patterns, good error handling.

### Step 8: Documentation (`step-08-documentation`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "As the Squad Documenter, generate complete API documentation for the review and recommendation system." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** Created `docs/REVIEW-API.md` — Full API reference with request/response examples for all 8 endpoints.

### Step 9: Retrospective (`step-09-retrospective`)

```bash
gh copilot -- -p "Run a sprint retrospective for the SQUAD feature development." --allow-all-tools --yolo
```

**Result:** 17/17 tasks completed. Action items: add JWT auth, Redis caching, integration tests, rate limiting.
